This cram_package includes a cram implementation of the directory task (dt) experiment. The implementention is based on the 
[ui_dt_pepper/shortDemo](https://github.com/RIS-WITH/ui_dt_pepper/tree/shortDemo)

The high-level task of the dt is implemented in cram_language. It includes further the concepts of interaction-designators, agent-designators and message-designators. The agent interaction can be therefore symbollically described:

```lisp
what is your agent name?
"human_0"
what do you want?
"Take the green cube"

```

to run the demo:

0. launch everything related tp the demo (see [RIS Documentation](https://github.com/RIS-WITH/ris_with_documentation))
1. launch: rosrun tf2_ros buffer_server
1. start emacs from shell: roslisp_repl
2. in emacs load the cram_package:  
```lisp
(ros-load:load-system "cram_pepper_dt_demo" :cram-pepper-dt-demo)
(in-package :pepper-dt-demo)
```
    - the compiler will throw an error because of a missing package - you can accept the fact (the next error relates to this one and can be accepted too)
3. 
```lisp
(in-package :pepper-dt-demo)
```
4.
. initialize the demo: 
```lisp
(init-demo)
```

5. start the demo: 
```lisp
(start-dt-demo)
```
